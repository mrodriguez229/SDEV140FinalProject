# SDEV140FinalProject
This is for an application called RestaurantBillApp.

The purpose of this app is to simplify ordering items off a restaurant’s menu and billing the customer the corresponding price of all the items on their bill including gratuity.

•	Prevents confusion with staff
•	Calculates the proper amount the customer owes
•	Adds tax and gives appropriate amount for gratuity
•	Will help the dining experience be efficient and fast

The app will go through and ask how many people are in the party that will be dining. Then the app will filter through each person and ask what they eat. The items they chose will correspond to a price and those prices will be added up to a bill where tax and the option for 18%, 20%, and 22% gratuity will be added, and the total will be given to the party.

The target audience for this application would be the restaurant staff who will need to learn how the system works to properly use it in their restaurant daily and also the customers who will be using the app when they visit the restaurant every time.
